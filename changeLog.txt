Release notes:
--------------
- 2.0.5 Bugs and improvements
    - Added support for drag and dropping the (i) icon of the Location bar
        https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/8
    - Changed shortcut for MacOS to Alt+B
        https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/4
    - Corrected a bug when copy-pasting into a folder
    - Changed cut behavior to leave bookmark in place, but dimmed, until it is
      pasted (moved) into its new place.
        https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/15
    - Changed menu "Paste" action to "paste before" to make it more obvious, compared
      to "Paste into".
    - Removed a limitation that inserting/creating a bookmark was not visible immediately
      when under a closed folder which was however expanded because of a show result in bookmark
      pane.
    - Corrected a bug when dragging a link to the bookmark tree and its title had special
      characters like "|", which made the properties panel showing trunked information.
    - Changed order of actions in search result context menu for a bookmark to ensure the default
      action is always at top.
        https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/3
    - Revamped a little the Options panel.
    - Changed default behavior on search results to always "Show bookmark" only (unless Shift is
      pressed at same time, which is opening the result bookmark in active tab at same time).
        https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/14
    - Added an Advanced mode preference for users who want to keep a varying behavior when clicking on
      different parts of a search result bookmark, like was the case in old "Sidebar Bookmark
      Search Plus" (default being not checked, in line with previous item):
      - "Show bookmark" only when clicking outside favicon and text,
      - "Show bookmark" + "Open" in active tab when clicking on favicon or text.
        https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/14 
    - Improved context menu in Advanced mode on search result bookmarks, to highlight "Show bookmark"
      as default action when right clicking outside of favicon and text, and "Open" when
      right clicking on favicon or text.
        https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/3
    - Added quit context menu through Esc key without selecting anything when the sidebar has
      focus
        https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/9 
    - Added close search on pressing Esc key when the search input has focus
        https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/10
    - Added a preference <[ ] On "Show bookmark", force state to open for all ancestor folders of shown
      bookmark> to set to open state all folders leading to the bookmark being shown from a search
      result.
      Default value of the preference is unchecked = those folder have their current state untouched,
      showing all bookmarks on the path to the selected one independent of close or open state
      of their folders. When checked, those folders are forced to open state.
      In both cases, checked or unchecked, the user can modify the state of folders by clicking
      on twisties.
      And when closing the search, the tree is reset to the state of each folder at moment of
      search close: open folders remain open, and closed folders have their bookmarks hidden again.

- 2.0.4 Bugs and improvements
    - Display text besides the animated waiting image at add-on load, to explain this is is for
      loading and preparing bookmarks pane.
    - Added some perf measurements in traces about loading & displaying, to prepare for
      assessing any perfs impact or display improvements of true asynchronous load when coming.
    - Display in traces font-family and size used by the platform to prepare for adding an option
      later of setting fonts.
    - Cosmetics on row highlighting
    - Streamlined display structure to gain a few marginal perfs.
    - Removed a weird effect on continuous window actions (= drag, move vertical scroll bar ..)
      being delayed or perturbed while loading favicons = hashed move, non responsive for some
      time, action registered but happening much later ..
      Looks ok now, but not sure of the exact cause, signal me if there is still some problems.
    - Added "Show bookmark" action in results context menu in search pane, as another
      way to show the source row, in addition to clicking outside favicon or text part.
        https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/3 
    - Added Shift+Click to systematically open a bookmark or search result in current tab,
      wherever we click on the row (without Shift, this is only when clicking on the favicon
      or on the text).
        https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/3 
    - Configured Middle click on bookmarks to open in a new tab next to current bookmark.
        https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/3 
    - Corrected a bug when dragging a tab over results rows and going to bookmarks pane,
      triggering a TypeError: row is undefined.
    - Corrected a bug where menu entries in bold (= default) in a context menu were not actioned.
    - Corrected a few minor bugs, no effect, but cleaner without them.
- 2.0.3 Bugs and improvements
    - Corrected bug on search result highlight showing all items under first open ancestor,
      and not just the ones at higher level on the path to that ancestor
    	https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/6
    - Corrected behavior of insert (right click) so as to insert a new item into a folder and
      not before it, to better mimick the native FF Bookmark sidebar behavior.
        https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/5
    - Changed the keyboard shortcut to Ctrl+Shift+B in Linux and to Ctrl+Q for other platforms,
      for not hitting already existing combinations on FF .. (which vary by platform)
        https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/4
    - Changed default state of folders when no info on them (add-on install, or new folder)
      so that the folder is now closed by default.
      That should make life easier for people with large number of bookmarks, and is also
      preparing for visual perf improvement with asynchronous/background load and display,
      an improvement to come later.

- 2.0.2	Reduce console logging to only error cases when retrieving favicons
- 2.0.1	Initial release version


LIMitations / TODO's:
---------------------
- TODO: Start to display even when not all is loaded/ready. Enable search, but identify
  those search result rows which cannot be shown yet, because not yet loaded/displayed,
  and disable the "Show" action from context menu.
    https://github.com/aaFn/Bookmark-search-plus-2/issues/2
 
- TODO: Internationalization (i18n) of the UI with users who want to help.
  Currently only english available.

- TODO: I have no Mac nor Open/FreeBSD, cannot verify how this is behaving under them, and if
  there are also variations / different bugs there .. I am hoping that since these are all
  BSD UNIX, this is similar or not far from Linux .. Have to rely solely on user feedback
  for that piece.

- TODO: Android and Chrome OS also ? Are mobile users going to have that many bookmarks and
  install + make use of that extension ?? Again, will wait for user feedback.

- TODO: Resize of search results pane is not yet retained / displayed as an option.
  So it is reset at each sidebar reload.

- TODO: Ignore favicon links when they are in comments when retrieving favicons from a page
  (since I am using a quick parser of my own, it is not semantical, and therefore it is misled
   when there are such rel= links inside comments <!-- -->, as it takes them for real).
   This is a rare case, but it happens.
   For examble: https://sol-resine.ooreka.fr/comprendre/resine-sol-garage
 
- TODO: Add massive refresh of all favicons, apart from the initial load at first start of the
  sidebar just after installing the add-on.
  For now, this can only be done individually by right clicking on bookmark items, one by one.

- TODO: Add section to show the current tab as a "simili bookmark", allowing:
    - local (inside sidebar, more practical) drag & drop for bookmark creation,
    - on double click or right click menu, expands as a tabs panel for switching very quickly when we
      have large number of open tabs (similar to "Tab Sidebar" and "Vertical Tabs Reloaded" add-ons),
    - double click back or right click menu on it to restore the Bookmarks view,
    - and most of all to search on them (not available in the two mentioned add-ons).

- TODO: Use topSites API to fill the Most visited part of bookmarks (currently just a special
  icon / bookmark item without any href, should become a folder with up to 10 items inside).

- TODO: Use bookmarks.getRecent() to fill the Recently bookmarked part of bookmarks (currently
  just a special icon / bookmark item without any href, should become a folder with up to 10 items
  inside).

- TODO: Be able to select and manipulate multiple bookmark items with Shift+arrow-up/down,
  Shift-hold+click and Ctrl-hold+click.



- LIM: When retrieving favicons, it seems that following redirects in fetch() is not perfect,
  and so we end up with Network errors where the normal browser on such a page gets to some
  other page and finds a favicon ..
  Tried {redirect: "follow"} without success ... :-(

- LIM: Pasting a folder and its object is slow. It has the approximate rhythm of 1 item by second.
  That appears inherent to the Firefox bookmarks.create() method (bug ??).
  I couldn't find any way to accelerate it, and there is no other available method to
  create BookmarkTreeNode subtrees in one shot.

- LIM: Did not find a way in Web Extension API's to open modal dialogs for "New bookmark.." and
  "New folder.." actions on context menus.
  So these are normal popups .. hope this won't be too much trouble. 

- LIM: No access to the sqlite db of favicons. So I had to code myself the fetch of favicons
  from pages, and then save them into local storage for next time the sidebar is loaded.
  This could make initial load of the add-on quite active, and so I spaced retrieval actions
  so as to not overload the normal browser process.
  On next loads after initial, things are retrieved from local storage, so this is fast.
  Note: the web retrieval process is not based on 'http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain_url='
    as some other add-ons do, as I it can be seen as a privacy issue leaking info to google.
    Instead, I am retrieving the favicon URL from inside the bookmarked HTML page with my own
    quick parser as said above.

- LIM: No management / display of bookmark tags, keywords, description field .. as Firefox does
  not expose those fields through its Web Extension API's.

- LIM: No way to synchronize the folders open state with the native FF bookmarks sidebar,
  or with the "All bookmarks" window, as this is not exposed by the Web Extension API's.
