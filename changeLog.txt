2.0.2	Reduce console logging to only error cases when retrieving favicons
2.0.1	Initial release version


LIMitations / TODO's:
---------------------
- BUG: When drawing a tab to bookmark it and it goes over results rows, apparently getting
  TypeError: row is undefined  panel.js:1972:9 -> bkmkDragEnterHandler
  TypeError: row is undefined  panel.js:2008:9 -> bkmkDragOverHandler
  TypeError: row is undefined  panel.js:2075:9 -> bkmkDragExitHandler
  TypeError: row is undefined  panel.js:2045:9 -> bkmkDragLeaveHandler

- TODO: Internationalization (i18n) of the UI with users who want to help.
  Currently only english available.

- TODO: more tests under Linux ? Indeed, some behavior (and Firefox bugs ...) are different
  from Windows.

- TODO: I have no Mac nor Open/FreeBSD, cannot verify how this is behaving under them, and if
  there are also variations / different bugs there .. I am hoping that since these are all
  BSD UNIX, this is similar or not far from Linux .. Have to rely solely on user feedback
  for that piece.

- TODO: Android and Chrome OS also ? Are mobile users going to have that many bookmarks and
  install + make use of that extension ?? Again, will wait for user feedback.

- TODO: Resize of search results pane is not yet retained / displayed as an option.
  So it is reset at each sidebar reload.

- TODO: Ignore favicon links when they are in comments when retrieving favicons from a page
  (since I am using a quick parser of my own, it is not semantical, and therefore it is misled
   when there are such rel= links inside comments <!-- -->, as it takes them for real).
   This is a rare case, but it happens.

- TODO: Add massive refresh of all favicons, apart from the initial load at first start of the
  sidebar just after installing the add-on.
  For now, this can only be done individually by right clicking on bookmark items, one by one.

- TODO: Add section to show the current tab as a "simili bookmark", allowing:
    - local (inside sidebar, more practical) drag & drop for bookmark creation,
    - on double click or right click menu, expands as a tabs panel for switching very quickly when we
      large number of open tabs (similar to "Tab Sidebar" and "Vertical Tabs Reloaded" add-ons),
    - double click back or right click menu on it to restore the Bookmarks view,
    - and most of all to search on them (not available in the two mentioned add-ons).

- TODO: Use topSites API to fill the Most visited part of bookmarks (currently just a special
  icon / bookmark item without any href, should become a folder with up to 10 items inside).

- TODO: Use bookmarks.getRecent() to fill the Recently bookmarked part of bookmarks (currently
  just a special icon / bookmark item without any href, should become a folder with up to 10 items
  inside).

- TODO: Be able to select and manipulate multiple bookmark items with Shift+arrow-up/down,
  Shift-hold+click and Ctrl-hold+click.



- LIM: When retrieving favicons, it seems that following redirects in fetch() is not perfect,
  and so we end up with Network errors where the normal browser on such a page gets to some
  other page and finds a favicon ..
  Tried {redirect: "follow"} without success ... :-(

- LIM: Pasting a folder and its object is slow. It has the approximate rhythm of 1 item by second.
  That appears inherent to the Firefox bookmarks.create() method (bug ??).
  I couldn't find any way to accelerate it, and there is no other available method to
  create BookmarkTreeNode subtrees in one shot.

- LIM: Did not find a way in Web Extension API's to open modal dialogs for "New bookmark.." and
  "New folder.." actions on context menus.
  So these are normal popups .. hope this won't be too much trouble. 

- LIM: No access to the sqlite db of favicons. So I had to code myself the fetch of favicons
  from pages, and then save them into local storage for next time the sidebar is loaded.
  This could make initial load of the add-on quite active, and so I spaced retrieval actions
  so as to not overload the normal browser process.
  On next loads after initial, things are retrieved from local storage, so this is fast.
  Note: the web retrieval process is not based on 'http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain_url='
    as some other add-ons do, as I it can be seen as a privacy issue leaking info to google.
    Instead, I am retrieving the favicon URL from inside the bookmarked HTML page with my own
    quick parser as said above.

- LIM: No management / display of bookmark tags, keywords, description field .. as Firefox does
  not expose those fields through its Web Extension API's.
